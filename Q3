=========DATA GROWTH =========
If the data is to increase in volume, solutions like 
APACHE SPARK and DASK would be used to process the data,
and a workflow manager like AIRFLOW/PREFECT would be used.

Additionally in production a scalable webserver like NGINX
would be used to serve the app to ensure consistency and
reverse proxy and load balancing when requests increase in number.
